The project deals with creating a User interface for weather API with dynamic approach using Ajax.

It is implemented using python in flask app with a front end using the ajax for not reloading the entire page.

The csv file of input date is read and display the Tmax and Tmin temperatures of the next five days from the given date.

Then it will count how many number of days it has appended data. if it is less than 5, then it is going to extract the data from the third party api(Yahoo weather API).

And in the front end, the graph is plotted in html using canvas of dates and temperatures.

YAHOO weather Api is used for forecasting the weather of next five days from the current date.
